# Battle Cats
like battleship, but with cats

First attempt at TDD -- project can definitely be improved in this respect.

Still wrapping my head around composition vs inheritance and experimentation
with such may have played a role in hindering my ability to create pure,
easily testable functions. Avoidance of tightly coupled code is an area
in need of improvement. 

Recently learned about recursion, so experimented with that in bot file. 
Bot is programmed to assess potential of moves, increasing challenge.

I created the cat SVG's in inkscape and created the sound effects and music
using 'beepbox.co' and/or garageband.
